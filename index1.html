        <h2 id="history">History</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><p>The Chicago Bulls are an American professional basketball team based in Chicago. The Bulls compete in the National Basketball Association
        (NBA) as a member club of the league’s Eastern Conference Central Division. The team was founded on January 16, 1966. The team plays its
        home games at the United Center, an arena shared with the Chicago Blackhawks of the National Hockey League (NHL). The Bulls saw their 
        greatest success during the 1990s. They are known for having one of the NBA’s greatest dynasties, winning six NBA championships between 
        1991 and 1998 with two three-peats. All six championship teams were led by Hall of Famers Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen and coach Phil 
        Jackson. The Bulls are the only NBA franchise to win multiple championships and never lose an NBA Finals series in their history.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p><img class="img-txt" src="image/history_1.jpeg" alt="history_foto_1">The Chicago Bulls are the third NBA franchise in Chicago, after the Packers – Zephyrs (now the Washington Wizards) and the Stags (1946 – 1950). 
        The Bulls’ founder, Dick Klein, was the Bulls’ only owner to ever play professional basketball (for the Chicago American Gears). 
        He served as the Bulls’ president and general manager in their beginning years. 
        The team started in the 1966 – 1967 NBA season, and posted the best record by an expansion team in NBA history. 
        Coached by Chicagoan and former NBA star Johnny “Red” Kerr, and led by former NBA assist leader Guy Rodgers and forward Bob Boozer, 
        the Bulls qualified for the playoffs, the only NBA team to do so in their first season.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p><img class="img-txt" src="image/history_2.jpeg" alt="history_foto_2">
        In the summer of 1984, the Bulls had the third pick of the 1984 NBA Draft, 
        after Houston and Portland. The Rockets selected Hakeem Olajuwon, the Blazers 
        picked Sam Bowie and the Bulls chose shooting guard Michael Jordan. The team,
        with new management in owner Jerry Reinsdorf and general manager Jerry Krause,
        decided to rebuild around Jordan. Jordan set franchise records during his rookie
        campaign for scoring (third in the league) and steals (fourth), and led the Bulls 
        back to the playoffs, where they lost in four games to the Milwaukee Bucks. For his
        efforts, he was rewarded with a selection to the All-NBA Second Team and the NBA Rookie of the Year Award.</p>

          NBA Finals – 1991<br>
        The Chicago Bulls of the Eastern Conference took on the Los Angeles Lakers of the Western Conference for the title,
        with Chicago having home court advantage. This Finals was Michael Jordan’s first NBA Finals appearance,
        Magic Johnson’s last one, and the last NBA Finals trip of the Lakers until 2000. The Bulls would win the series 4-1.
        Jordan averaged 31.2 points on 56% shooting, 11.4 assists, 6.6 rebounds, 2.8 steals and 1.4 blocks en route to his first NBA Finals MVP Award. </p>
          <p>
            NBA Finals – 1992<br>
        The 1992 NBA Finals was the championship round of the 1991 – 1992 NBA season. The Chicago Bulls of the Eastern Conference took 
        on the Portland Trail Blazers of the Western Conference for the title, with Chicago having home court advantage, as they had 
        the best record in the NBA. The Bulls would go on to win the series in six games. Michael Jordan was named Finals Most Valuable Player 
        for the second year in a row, to go with his sixth straight regular season scoring titles.
